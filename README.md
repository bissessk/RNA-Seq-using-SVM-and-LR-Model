# RNA-Seq-using-SVM-and-LR-Model
Support Vector Machine and Logisitic Regression models were used determine the mutation given a set of values for the different genes.

RNA-seq is a method of detecting gene transcript abundance. For a given sample, the number of sequencing reads matching a specific gene is reported. In this dataset, the normalized RNA-seq counts have been provided for over 20,000 genes from different mutant samples. Our goal is to be able to determine the mutation given a set of values for the different genes ( 20,000+ ).

Expression values are provided in `data.csv` and the labels for the samples are provided in `labels.csv`.
